# Given an array arr[] of n integers, construct a Product Array prod[] (of same size) such that prod[i] is equal to the product of all the elements of arr[] except arr[i]. Solve it without division operator in O(n) time.

Example : 

Try Amazon Test Series that Includes topic-wise practice questions on all important DSA topics along with 10 practice contests of 2 hours each. Designed with years of experience.

Input: arr[]  = {10, 3, 5, 6, 2}
